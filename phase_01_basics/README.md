# Phase 1: Python Basics - Your Starting Point!

**Est. Time to Complete**: 20-30 hours  
**Difficulty Level**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: None - Start here!  

---

## Learning Outcomes

After completing Phase 1, you will:

- Write your first Python program
- Understand and use variables
- Work with different data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Use arithmetic and comparison operators  
- Get input from users
- Use the print() function effectively
- Build a complete working program

---

## Lessons in This Phase

### Lesson 1: Hello World!
Your very first Python program. Learn print() and output text.

### Lesson 2: Variables
Store and manipulate data with variables.

### Lesson 3: Data Types
Understand int, float, str, and bool.

### Lesson 4: Operators
Math, comparison, and logical operations.

### Lesson 5: User Input  
Get data from users with input().

### Project: Circle Calculator
Calculate area and circumference of circles.

## Files in This Phase

- `lesson_01_hello_world.py` - Your first program
- `lesson_02_variables.py` - Variables basics
- `lesson_03_data_types.py` - Data types exploration
- `lesson_04_operators.py` - All operators explained
- `lesson_05_user_input.py` - Getting user input
- `project_circle_calculator.py` - Complete mini-project
- `exercises.py` - Practice problems

## Key Concepts

### print() - Display Output
```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Learning Python")
```

### Variables - Store Values
```python
name = "Karthik"
age = 15
marks = 95.5
```

### Data Types
- `int` - Integers (whole numbers): 5, 10, -3
- `float` - Decimals: 3.14, 9.8  
- `str` - Text (strings): "Hello", 'Python'
- `bool` - True or False

### Operators
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, **
- Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical: and, or, not

### input() - Get User Data
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

## Quick Start

1. Open `lesson_01_hello_world.py`
2. Read the code carefully
3. Run it in your Python IDE  
4. Modify it and experiment
5. Try the exercises
6. Move to next lesson

---

## Learning Path

Start -> Lesson 1 -> Lesson 2 -> Lesson 3 -> Lesson 4 -> Lesson 5 -> Project -> Exercises -> Phase 2!

---

## Next Phase

Once you complete all lessons and the project, you're ready for:
**Phase 2: Control Flow (if/else, loops)**

**You've got this! Let's code! 🚀**
