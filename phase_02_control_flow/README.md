# Phase 2: Control Flow - Python Mastery India\n\n## Overview\nPhase 2 is dedicated to **Control Flow** - one of the fundamental concepts in programming. This phase covers conditional statements and loops, which allow you to make decisions in your code and repeat actions efficiently.\n\n## Phase Objective\nMaster the ability to:\n- Write conditional logic (if/else/elif)\n- Implement loops (while, for)\n- Control loop execution with break and continue\n- Apply these concepts to real-world Indian scenarios\n\n## Lessons in This Phase\n\n### 📚 Lesson 1: If/Else Statements\n**File:** `lesson_03_if_else_statements.py`\n- Basic if syntax\n- elif and else clauses\n- Nested conditions\n- Multiple conditions (and, or)\n- Indian context: JEE scores, school admissions\n\n### 📚 Lesson 2: While Loops\n**File:** `lesson_04_while_loops.py`\n- While loop syntax\n- Loop control\n- Break and continue basics\n- Infinite loop concepts\n- Indian context: Bank PIN, exam attempts\n\n### 📚 Lesson 3: For Loops\n**File:** `lesson_05_for_loops.py`\n- For loop with range()\n- Iterating through sequences\n- Nested loops\n- Enumerate function\n- Indian context: Cricket scorecard, shopping lists\n\n### 📚 Lesson 4: Break and Continue\n**File:** `lesson_06_break_continue.py`\n- Break statement for early termination\n- Continue to skip iterations\n- Loop-else combinations\n- Real-world applications\n- Indian context: ATM PIN validation, attendance\n\n## Learning Path\n

  v\nLesson 1: If/Else (Decision Making)\n  |\n  v\nLesson 2: While Loops (Iteration)\n  |\n  v\nLesson 3: For Loops (Sequence Iteration)\n  |\n  v\nLesson 4: Break/Continue (Advanced Control)\n  |\n  v\nEnd of Phase 2\n```\n\n## Skills You Will Gain\n\n✅ **Conditional Logic:** Write programs that make decisions\n✅ **Iteration:** Repeat code blocks efficiently\n✅ **Loop Control:** Manage loop flow with break and continue\n✅ **Problem Solving:** Apply control flow to real scenarios\n✅ **Code Quality:** Write clean, efficient code\n\n## Practice Recommendations\n\n1. **Type Along:** Don't just read the code, type it yourself\n2. **Experiment:** Modify examples and see what happens\n3. **Indian Context:** Relate examples to your life\n4. **Exercises:** Complete all Easy/Medium/Hard exercises\n5. **Combine Concepts:** Mix if/else with loops\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n
⚠️ Forgetting colons (`:`) after if/for/while statements\n⚠️ Incorrect indentation in Python\n⚠️ Infinite loops (especially with while)\n⚠️ Using `=` instead of `==` in comparisons\n⚠️ Off-by-one errors with range()\n\n## Resources\n- Python Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/\n- Interactive Coding: Try examples in Python IDE\n- Indian Examples: Relate to JEE, Cricket, Shopping\n\n## What's Next?\n
After completing Phase 2, you'll be ready for:\n- **Phase 3:** Functions and Code Organization\n- **Phase 4:** Data Structures (Lists, Dicts, Tuples)\n- **Phase 5:** File Handling and I/O\n\n## Estimated Time**\n- Lessons: 2-3 hours\n- Exercises: 1-2 hours\n- Practice: As much as needed\n- **Total:** 5-7 hours for complete mastery\n\n---\n\n**Created by:** Python Mastery India\n**Updated:** December 2025\n**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
